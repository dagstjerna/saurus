### About
Saurus is a dynamic, lightweight, general purpose programming language. The VM is written in portable C and can be easily embedded in another C or C++ program. The language is simple, powerful and dynamic in a fashion familiar to most programmers. Saurus is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system.
